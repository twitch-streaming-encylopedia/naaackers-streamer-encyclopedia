## Introduction

Hello there! My name is [Naaackers](https://twitter.com/naaackers) and this is the the Streamer Encyclopedia. I’ve been streaming on Twitch for 5 years and have gathered quite the amount of information about streaming on Twitch. I have never paid for any of the knowledge I’ve gained during my time on Twitch, and you shouldn’t have to either. The power of the internet has granted me the ability to become a skilled broadcaster at the expense of my time and not my money. You can do the same if you have the determination! \
 \
There is an abundance of information below. If you have a specific topic you are looking to read more about, please check out the ‘Table of Contents’ below. Regardless, I would still suggest to do a once over of all the information below to see if there is something worth researching!  \


New streamers, be sure to check out my [Things to Consider](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19VJT4Ul9RJXpaIaVl0tC1dBElewhsv2XJ8PmjXgx_HA/edit?usp=sharing) document when starting out on this journey. There are a few key points to be aware of! They are important. In addition to that, please check out the [Twitch Creator Camp](https://www.twitch.tv/creatorcamp/en/?tt_medium=owned_onsite_twitch&tt_content=creator_camp_creators_all_all_Blog&ttid=225e6547a6) for a myriad of help articles.
